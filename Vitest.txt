you can use Vitest for testing in your Next.js project! Vitest is a fast unit test framework similar to Jest, and it integrates well with modern JavaScript frameworks like Next.js.

Here’s how you can set it up:

Step-by-Step Setup:
Install Vitest and Related Packages: Since you use pnpm, run the following command to install Vitest:

pnpm add -D vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom jsdom

Update package.json: Add a test script for Vitest in your package.json:

{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "vitest"
  }
}
Create a Vitest Config: In the root of your project, create a vitest.config.ts file:

ts
Copy code
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    environment: 'jsdom',
    globals: true,
    setupFiles: './vitest.setup.ts',
  },
});
Set Up Testing Environment: Create a vitest.setup.ts file in your root folder for global configuration:

ts
Copy code
import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
Write a Simple Test: Inside your __tests__ folder or any test folder you prefer, create a sample test file App.test.tsx:

tsx
Copy code
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import Home from '../app/page';

test('renders the home page', () => {
  render(<Home />);
  expect(screen.getByText('Welcome to the BCFCODEWars!')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
Run the Tests: Now, you can run the tests with the command:

bash
Copy code
pnpm test
Additional Configuration
If you want coverage reports, you can add c8:
bash
Copy code
pnpm add -D c8
Update the test script in package.json:
json
Copy code
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:coverage": "vitest run --coverage"
  }
}
With these steps, you’ll have Vitest set up for your Next.js project!
