/**
 * GaugeView Component
 *
 * A high-level layout component responsible for displaying a complete gauge unit,
 * including both the animated gauge (`SingleGauge`) and its accompanying text info (`Texts`).
 *
 * @component
 * @example
 * <GaugeView type="monthly" index={2} />
 *
 *
 * Composition:
 * - Renders a `SingleGauge` to visually represent percentage.
 * - Renders `Texts` to show descriptive status or progress text.
 * - Uses MUIâ€™s `Stack` and `Box` for semantic and layout consistency.
 *
 * Best Practices:
 * - Separation of visual and textual feedback into distinct components improves modularity.
 * - Keeps components focused on their own responsibilities for better testability and reusability.
 * - Top-down prop flow (index/type) ensures synchronization across children components.
