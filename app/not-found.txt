Creating a custom "Not Found" (404) page with a John Travolta "Pulp Fiction" Confused GIF in a Next.js app is a fun way to personalize your error handling! Here's how you can build it step-by-step:

Step-by-Step Guide
Create a Custom 404 Page:

In Next.js, you can create a custom 404 page by making a file called 404.js or 404.tsx in the pages directory.
GIF Source:

Download the John Travolta Confused GIF or find a URL that hosts it. For this example, I'll assume you have a URL for the GIF like https://example.com/john-travolta-confused.gif.
Building the 404 Component:

Add styling directly using inline CSS to keep it simple. The following example uses the Box component from Material-UI to style the page.
Sample Code for pages/404.tsx
javascript
Copy code
// pages/404.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Box, Typography } from '@mui/material';

// GIF URL (Replace with your local path or URL if you have a different source)
const GIF_URL = 'https://example.com/john-travolta-confused.gif';

const NotFoundPage = () => {
  return (
    <Box
      sx={{
        display: 'flex',
        flexDirection: 'column',
        alignItems: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'center',
        height: '100vh',
        bgcolor: 'background.default',
        color: 'text.primary',
        textAlign: 'center',
        p: 3,
      }}
    >
      <Typography
        variant="h3"
        sx={{ mb: 2, fontWeight: 'bold', color: 'error.main' }}
      >
        404 - Page Not Found
      </Typography>
      <Box
        component="img"
        src={GIF_URL}
        alt="John Travolta Confused"
        sx={{
          width: '300px',
          height: 'auto',
          mb: 3,
        }}
      />
      <Typography variant="h5" sx={{ color: 'text.secondary' }}>
        Oops! It seems the page you are looking for doesn't exist.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ color: 'text.secondary', mt: 2 }}>
        Try checking the URL or head back to the DashboardPage.
      </Typography>
    </Box>
  );
};

export default NotFoundPage;
Explanation
Imports: Using Box and Typography from Material-UI for styling.
GIF Integration: The GIF is displayed using a <Box> component with component="img" and src set to the GIF URL.
Styling:
The page centers the content vertically and horizontally using flex properties.
Colors are managed using Material-UI's theme settings, like bgcolor for background and color for text.
Responsive and adaptive to different screen sizes.
Additional Tips
Custom Styling: You can use CSS-in-JS for more complex styling or switch to styled-components if you prefer.
Button to Redirect: You can add a button to redirect back to the DashboardPage if you want.
Local GIF: If you have the GIF locally, put it in the public folder of your project and update the src to something like /john-travolta-confused.gif.
How to Test
Run your Next.js app:
bash
Copy code
npm run dev
Go to a URL that doesn't exist, like http://localhost:3000/non-existent-page, and check the custom 404 page.
Feel free to ask if you want a different design or specific styling!
